## Q1.1 Abstract

This AI agent is designed to predict match outcomes in League of Legends based on in-game statistics. Using a dataset containing high-ranked matches with detailed in-game metrics—such as minion kills, gold earned, experience gained, jungle control, and objective captures—the agent analyzes early-game conditions and predicts whether a team will win or lose.
The agent operates as a goal-based AI, focusing solely on maximizing the accuracy of its match outcome predictions. Given the strong conditional dependencies among in-game variables (e.g., minion kills correlating with gold and experience leads), the agent leverages a machine learning model trained on historical match data to recognize patterns that indicate a likely victory or defeat.
